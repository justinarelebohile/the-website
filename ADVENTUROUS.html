	Imagine how hard it is to break up asphalt with a pickaxe.
	Now imagine it's not even a very good pickaxe. And you've been doing it for days.
	The sun, hotter now, makes the sweat bead on your face, itchy like a bug landing
	on you. Sometimes enough water escapes your pores to form a little stream that 
	carves a path down the black dust on your face. And it tortures you that your body
	is letting such a precious resource just drip onto the ground. Unretrievable.</p>

	I sat with my head resting against the window of the train, my right hand under my
	chin – supporting my head – and my left, holding a worn copy of Call Me By Your Name.
	My mind, wandering in and out of reality, may have forgotten my destination and considered
	that I was travelling to or from university (as I had done so often the last three years),
	had it have not been for my large, red suitcase that was pressed up against my knees. 
   I was travelling from my home on London’s outskirts, into the centre of the city – to the airport.
   Over and over, I questioned herself as to whether I had my passport, my boarding pass and the
   euros that my dad had slid into my jacket pocket as they had parted ways outside the front of my 
	house, whilst the taxi-driver had lifted the suitcase as if it were an empty cardboard box.</p>
