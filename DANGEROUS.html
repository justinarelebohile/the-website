A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of
the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back”. In this part of the story
Montresor is suffocating and struggling Fortunado and slowing killing him and 
lining the rest of the bricks in the corner. Montresor pulled the wool over 
Fortunado’s eyes and deceiving him, when he thought Montresor was his friend.
“But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient.

<p>Amontillado" Fortunado is misled to be killed by Montresor like "Pretty Little Liars",
   the 4 girls are misled to who killed their best friend Alison. The similarities are 
   that there is a murder that tricks the characters and finds information about them and
   uses it against them. Also Fortunado and the 4 girls are somewhat in a vulnerable state
   and the killers use it against them. Everytime I watch "Pretty Little Liars" I would 
   get mislead to who the killer was. The writers did this on purpose to make sure we 
   kept watching. The entire time I would spring out of my seat belting out at the tv 
   wondering who could be "A".  I would sometimes think that this girl named Jenna was
   "A" because she had a outing for Alison who was mysteriously killed, Jenna in my 
   opinion was someone that secretly was a killer.</p>
